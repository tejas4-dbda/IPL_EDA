## IPL Data Analysis with Apache Spark

This project is focused on performing exploratory data analysis on Indian Premier League (IPL) datasets which are stored on S3 bucket using Apache Spark. The primary goal is to leverage Spark's distributed computing capabilities to process and analyze IPL data efficiently.

**Features**

•	Data Processing with PySpark: Utilize Spark's powerful data processing engine to handle and manipulate IPL datasets after fetching dataset from S3 bucket.

•	Custom SparkSession: Set up a dedicated Spark session tailored for IPL data analysis.

•	Comprehensive Data Analysis: Implement a range of data processing techniques, including filtering, aggregation, and window operations.

**Requirements**

•	DataBricks

•	Apache Spark 

•	PySpark

•	Python 3.7+

**Usage**

This notebook is designed for users who wish to explore IPL data, perform advanced queries, and generate insights using Spark. It is ideal for data engineers, analysts, or anyone interested in large-scale sports data analysis.
